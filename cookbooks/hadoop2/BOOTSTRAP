# Requirements
  - working zk cluster
  - per cluster
    - 3 journal nodes
    - 2 name nodes
    - 2 resource manager, n node managers
  - n data nodes

# Bootstraping Zookeeper:
  - zkCli -server zk create /hadoop2 hadoop2
  - zkCli -server zk create /hadoop2/rmstore hadoop2

# Bootstraping HDFS:
  - on 1st namenode:
      hdfs namenode -format
      hdfs zkfc -formatZK
  - on 2nd namenode:
      hdfs namenode -bootstrapStandby

Afer bootstraping all services should stay up, you might need to restart some as systemd already gave up.

# Verify setup
Check if datanodes are shown in both (per cluster) name nodes:
  - http://nn1:50070/dfshealth.html#tab-datanode
  - http://nn2:50070/dfshealth.html#tab-datanode

Note: data nodes must be visisble in all name nodes regardless of state

Check if all node managers show up in the resource managers (again per cluster):
  - http://rm1:50030/cluster/nodes
  - http://rm2:50030/cluster/nodes

Note: node managers are only visible in an active rm (so do test handover)
