# Overview

Every Chef installation needs a Chef Repository. This is the place where
cookbooks, roles, config files and other artifacts for managing systems with
Chef will live. We strongly recommend storing this repository in a version
control system such as Git and treat it like source code.

# Usage

Please refer to the [documentation](http://docs.zenops.net).
